                <p style=" background-color: black; color: white;">Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero
                    shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several
                    countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the
                    attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it.
                    Valorant was developed with two main focuses: making tactical shooters and e-sports more accessible
                    to new players, and creating a game that would attract a large competitive scene, while solving many
                    of the points of criticism voiced by professional players from games in the genre. Games aimed at
                    large, active communities and player bases, typically free-to-play games like Fortnite or Riot's own
                    League of Legends, tend to put an emphasis on a wider array of system performance improvements and
                    game stability rather than newer technologies or graphics as a way of making sure they're as
                    accessible as possible. In interviews leading up to the game's launch, game director Joe Ziegler and
                    producer Anna Donlon said that Valorant was made for people playing their first tactical shooter
                    just as much as it was for professional players, and that accessibility of the game was a large
                    priority.</p>
